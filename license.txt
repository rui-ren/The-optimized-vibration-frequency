7. LICENSES FOR THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE AND PRODUCTS.  MathWorks has been
   granted licenses to distribute certain Third Party software as part of a
   Program licensed under a separate license agreement.  These licenses
   require MathWorks to distribute the software to Licensee subject to 
   specific terms and conditions, which may be different from or additional
   to those contained herein.  Should such Third Party software be provided 
   under the Lesser General Public License, Licensee may make modifications
   of the work identified in Section 6 of the Lesser General Public License
   for Licensee's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such 
   modifications.  Licensee agrees that acceptance of this Agreement also 
   confirms Licensee's acceptance of any applicable Third Party software 
   licenses.  Such Third Party licenses may be viewed at 
   www.mathworks.com/thirdpartylicenseagreementsR2010b.  Licensee may also 
   contact MathWorks to obtain the current applicable provisions.  

8. SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE SERVICE. During any paid Software Maintenance
   Service term, if applicable, MathWorks shall provide Software Maintenance
   Service for the licensed Programs which consists of:  delivering
   subsequent releases of the Programs, if any, that are not charged for
   separately; exerting reasonable efforts to both (a) provide, within a
   reasonable time, workarounds for any material programming errors in the
   current release of the Programs that are directly attributable to
   MathWorks, and (b) correct such errors in the next available release,
   provided Licensee provides MathWorks with sufficient information to
   identify the errors.  During this same paid Software Maintenance Service
   term, Licensee shall also be entitled to receive technical support for
   the current release.  Technical support means assistance by telephone and
   electronic mail with the installation and/or use of the then-current
   release of the licensed Programs, including all available bug fixes and
   patches, and their interaction with supported hardware and operating
   systems ("Platforms").  MathWorks reserves the option to discontinue, in
   whole or in part, and at any time, offering Software Maintenance Service
   and/or technical support for any Program or Platform.

9. LICENSE DURATION ("TERM").  This Agreement shall continue until the
   earlier of (a) termination by MathWorks or Licensee as provided below, or
   (b) such time as there are no Programs being licensed to Licensee
   hereunder.  

  9.1. For Annual Licenses:  Licensee understands and agrees that each Annual
       License will expire automatically immediately after its corresponding
       one (1) year period, unless Licensee renews its License by remitting
       the then-current annual License fee.  Licensee understands that the
       Programs will stop operating unless Licensee pays the License fee and
       is provided new annual passcodes.   Licensee understands and agrees
       that the Software Maintenance Service for each Annual License will
       terminate automatically upon expiration of the Annual License Term. 
  
  9.2. For Term Licenses:  Licensee understands and agrees that each Term
       License will expire automatically immediately after the corresponding
       period of the term licensed, unless Licensee renews its License by
       remitting the then-current term License Fee.  Licensee understands that
       the Programs will stop operating unless Licensee pays the license fee
       and is provided new term passcodes.  Licensee understands and agrees
       that the Software Maintenance Service for each Term License will
       terminate automatically upon expiration of the License Term. 
  
  9.3. For Perpetual Licenses:  Licensee shall have the right to use the
       Programs indefinitely, subject to the termination provisions in this
       Agreement.  Licensee understands and agrees that the Software
       Maintenance Service for each Perpetual License will terminate
       automatically upon expiration of the initial Software Maintenance
       Service term included with the acquisition of the License.  Thereafter,
       the Software Maintenance Service term may be renewed for any Program,
       at the then-current price, and for the then-applicable term, as long as
       MathWorks offers such Software Maintenance Service for such Program.
  
  9.4. For Student Licenses:  See the Student Version Installation and Use
       Addendum for the License Term. 

10. TERMINATION.  MathWorks may terminate this Agreement and all Licenses
    granted hereunder by written notice to Licensee if Licensee breaches any
    material term of this License, including failure to pay any License fees
    due, and Licensee has not cured such breach within sixty (60) days of
    written notification.  MathWorks may immediately terminate upon notice
    this Agreement and all Licenses granted hereunder should Licensee breach
    the terms and conditions of Articles 3, 4, and/or 11.  Licensee may
    terminate this License at any time, for any reason.  Licensee shall not
    be entitled to any refund if this License is terminated, except for
    License fees paid for any Programs for which the Acceptance Period has
    not expired at the time of termination.  Upon termination, Licensee
    shall promptly return all but archival copies of the Programs in
    Licensee's possession or control, or promptly provide written
    certification of their destruction.

11. EXPORT CONTROL.  The Programs may be subject to U.S. export control laws
    or other (U.S. and non-U.S.) governmental export and import laws and
    regulations.  Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or Third
    Party agreement, Licensee's rights under this Agreement may not be
    exercised by Licensee or any Third Party in violation of such laws and
    regulations, nor may this Agreement be transferred to any party where
    doing so would result in such a violation.  The terms of any limitation
    on the use, transfer or re-export of the Programs imposed by MathWorks
    in any Destination Control Statement or other document for the purpose
    of export control shall prevail over any term in this Agreement.  It
    shall be Licensee's responsibility to comply with the latest United
    States or other governmental export and import regulations.

12. FEDERAL ACQUISITION.  This provision applies to all acquisitions of the
    Programs and Documentation by, for, or through the federal government of
    the United States.  By accepting delivery of the Programs or
    Documentation, the government hereby agrees that this software or
    documentation qualifies as commercial computer software or commercial
    computer software documentation as such terms are used or defined in FAR
    12.212, DFARS Part 227.72, and DFARS 252.227-7014.  Accordingly, the
    terms and conditions of this Agreement and only those rights specified
    in this Agreement, shall pertain to and govern the use, modification,
    reproduction, release, performance, display, and disclosure of the
    Programs and Documentation by the federal government (or other entity
    acquiring for or through the federal government) and shall supersede any
    conflicting contractual terms or conditions.  If this License fails to
    meet the government's needs or is inconsistent in any respect with
    federal procurement law, the government agrees to return the Programs
    and Documentation, unused, to MathWorks. 

13. FOR EUROPEAN UNION LICENSEES ONLY.  Any contractual provisions of this
    Agreement contrary to laws implemented under Article 6 of Appendix V of
    the European Union Software Directive or to the exceptions provided for
    in Article 5(2) and (3) of such Appendix shall be null and void solely
    to the extent decompiling, disassembling, or otherwise
    reverse-engineering of the Programs is necessary to enable the Licensee
    to create an independent program that is interoperable with the Programs
    or any other permitted objectives specified by such laws implemented
    under such directive (collectively, the "Permitted Objectives"),
    provided that any such information gained is used solely for such
    Permitted Objectives. 

14. TAXES, DUTIES, CUSTOMS.  Absent appropriate exemption certificates or
    other conclusive proof of tax exempt status, Licensee shall pay all
    applicable sales, use, excise, value-added, and other taxes, duties,
    levies, assessments, and governmental charges payable in connection with
    this Agreement or the Licenses granted hereunder, excluding taxes based
    on or measured by MathWorks' income, for which MathWorks shall be solely
    responsible. 

15. ASSIGNMENT.  Licensee may not assign or otherwise transfer this
    Agreement and its rights and obligations hereunder, in whole or in part,
    by operation of law or otherwise, without the written consent of
    MathWorks.  In the case of any permitted assignment or transfer of or
    under this Agreement, this Agreement or the relevant provisions shall be
    binding upon, and inure to the benefit of, the successors, executors,
    heirs, representatives, administrators and assigns of the parties
    hereto.  MathWorks may charge Licensee an administrative fee for any
    permitted assignment.

16. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  The Programs should not be relied on as the
    sole basis to solve a problem or implement a design whose incorrect
    solution or implementation could result in injury to person or property.
    If a Program is employed in such a manner, it is at the Licensee's own
    risk and MathWorks and its Licensors explicitly disclaim all liability
    for such misuse to the extent allowed by law.  MathWorks' and MathWorks'
    Licensors' liability for death or personal injury resulting from
    negligence or for any other matter in relation to which liability by law
    cannot be excluded or limited shall not be excluded or limited.  Except
    as aforesaid, (a) any other liability of MathWorks and its Licensors
    (whether in relation to breach of contract, negligence or otherwise)
    shall not in total exceed the amount paid to MathWorks under this
    Agreement in the twelve month period preceding the claim in question,
    for the Program with respect to which the liability in question arises;
    and (b) MathWorks and its Licensors shall have no liability for any
    indirect or consequential loss (whether foreseeable or otherwise and
    including loss of profits, loss of business, loss of opportunity, and
    loss of use of any computer hardware or software).  Some states do not
    allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
    damages, so the above exclusion or limitation may not apply to Licensee. 

17. LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF REMEDIES.  MathWorks warrants that
    MathWorks, on its own behalf or through its Licensors, has the right to
    grant the License rights hereunder.  MathWorks warrants that the
    physical media provided shall be free from defects in material and
    workmanship for a period of ninety (90) days from delivery, or it will
    be replaced by MathWorks at no cost to Licensee.  MathWorks further
    warrants, for a period of one (1) year from delivery or for the term of
    the License, whichever is less, that each copy of each Program will
    conform in all material respects to the description of such Program's
    operation in the Documentation.  In the event that a Program does not
    operate as warranted, Licensee's exclusive remedy and MathWorks' sole
    liability under this warranty shall be the correction or workaround by
    MathWorks of major defects within a reasonable time.  Should such
    correction or workaround be impractical, MathWorks may, at its option,
    terminate the relevant License and refund the initial License fee paid
    to MathWorks for such Program.  All requests for warranty assistance
    should be directed to The MathWorks, Inc., 3 Apple Hill Drive, Natick,
    MA 01760-2098, U.S.A.

18. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES.  Except for warranties expressly set forth in
    Article 17 of this Agreement (or as implied by law where the law
    provides that the particular terms implied cannot be excluded by
    contract), any and all Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance
    Services are delivered "as is" and MathWorks makes and the Licensee
    receives no additional express or implied warranties.  MathWorks and its
    Licensors hereby expressly disclaim any and all other conditions,
    warranties, or other terms of any kind or nature concerning the
    Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance Services (including,
    without limitation, any with regard to infringement, merchantability,
    quality, accuracy, or fitness for a particular purpose or Licensee's
    purpose).  MathWorks also expressly disclaims any warranties that may be
    implied from usage of trade, course of dealing, or course of
    performance.  Except for the express warranties stated in Article 17 of
    this Agreement, the Programs, Documentation, and Software Maintenance
    Services are provided with all faults, and the entire risk of
    satisfactory quality, performance, accuracy, and effort is with
    Licensee.  MathWorks does not warrant that the Programs and
    Documentation will operate without interruption or be error free.  Some
    states and countries do not allow limitations on how long an implied
    warranty lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to Licensee.  The
    warranty in Article 17 gives Licensee specific legal rights and Licensee
    may also have other rights which vary from state to state and country to
    country.  Licensee accepts responsibility for its use of the Programs
    and the results obtained therefrom.

19. GOVERNING LAW; JURISDICTION.  This Agreement shall be interpreted,
    enforced and construed and the rights of the parties hereunder governed
    in all respects by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, United
    States of America, without regard to its conflicts of law provisions,
    and both parties consent to the jurisdiction of the federal and state
    courts located in said Commonwealth and consent to the service of
    process, pleadings and notices in connection with any and all actions
    initiated in such courts.  The parties agree that a final judgment in
    any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and binding and may be
    enforced in any other jurisdiction.  To the extent any governing law,
    treaty, or regulation is in conflict with this Agreement, the
    conflicting terms of this Agreement shall be superseded only to the
    extent necessary by such law, treaty, or regulation.  If any provision
    of this Agreement shall be otherwise unlawful, void, or otherwise
    unenforceable, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent
    permissible.  In either case, the remainder of this Agreement shall not
    be affected.  The parties agree that the U.N. Convention on Contracts
    for the International Sale of Goods shall not apply to this Agreement.
    The parties further agree that the Uniform Computer Information
    Transactions Act, or any version thereof, adopted by any state, in any
    form ("UCITA"), shall not apply to this Agreement.  To the extent that
    UCITA is applicable, the parties agree to opt out of the applicability
    of UCITA pursuant to the Opt-Out provision(s) contained therein. 

20. COMPLIANCE AND AUDIT RIGHTS.  Licensee agrees to notify MathWorks
    promptly upon discovery of any failure to comply with one or more
    Licenses granted under this Agreement, or any failure to comply with any
    other material term of this Agreement.  To confirm Licensee's compliance
    with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Licensee agrees to
    allow MathWorks to audit Licensee's use of the Programs, and to provide
    MathWorks access to Licensee's facilities and computers, and cooperation
    from Licensee's employees and consultants, as reasonably requested by
    MathWorks in order to perform such audit, all during normal business
    hours, and after reasonable prior notice from MathWorks.  If an audit
    discloses that Licensee has failed to comply with one or more Licenses,
    and such failure to comply could have in part or in whole been avoided
    by Licensee having paid additional License fees to expand the scope of
    the License or Licenses, then Licensee shall promptly pay MathWorks such
    Licensing fees (at MathWorks' then current rates) and, if such unpaid
    License fees exceed 5% of the License fees paid to MathWorks for the
    applicable Programs during the applicable period during which such
    underpayment occurred, then Licensee shall, in addition to paying the
    unpaid License fees, also reimburse MathWorks the full cost of such
    audit.

21. LICENSE MANAGEMENT.  The Programs contain technology for the prevention
    of unlicensed use.  The Programs require activation to exercise your
    rights under this Agreement.  You may also need to activate if you
    redesignate the Programs on your License or modify your hardware.

    Activation associates the use of the Programs with a specific Computer,
    and in some cases the Licensed User.  During activation, data about the
    Programs and the Computer will be transmitted to MathWorks.  This data
    includes the License information, Computer identification, and location.
    Some License Options may require the MathWorks Account information and
    the operating system user name for the Licensed User.  A License file
    will be provided to complete activation.  

22. HEADINGS.  The inclusion of headings is for convenience of reference
    only and shall not affect the construction or interpretation of this
    Agreement.

23. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.  This Agreement, and any applicable Addendum thereto
    including any documents referenced therein are incorporated herein by
    reference, and contain the entire understanding of the parties and may
    not be modified or amended except by written instrument, executed by
    authorized representatives of MathWorks and Licensee.  In the event of
    any conflict between this Agreement and any purchase order executed by
    Licensee (whether executed before or after this Agreement), this
    Agreement shall prevail.

   Programs is determined by the License Option acquired, including the
   permitted Activation Type with respect to such License Option.  By
   accepting the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Licensee also
   accepts the License Option acquired.    

  3.1. License Options. 

    3.1.1. Individual.  Except as specifically set forth in Section 3.3
           hereof, the Individual License Option permits one Activation Type,
           either the Standalone Named User Activation Type or the Designated
           Computer Activation Type.  

    3.1.2. Network Named User.  Except as specifically set forth in Section
           3.3 hereof, the Network Named User License Option permits only the
           Network Named User Activation Type.  

    3.1.3. Concurrent.  Except as specifically set forth in Section 3.3
           hereof, the Concurrent License Option permits only the Network
           Concurrent User Activation Type.

  3.2. Activation Types.

    3.2.1. Standalone Named User.  Program use is restricted to the single,
           designated Named User.  Programs may be installed and operated on
           one or more individual Computers, provided the Programs are only
           accessible to, and operated by, the Named User for that License.
           The physical locations of the Computers used by the Named User to
           run the Programs are not limited; the Computers may be located at
           work, home, in a laboratory, or on a laptop.  Licensee may only
           designate one Licensed User access to or use of the Programs
           under each Named User License.  A Computer login of a Named User
           may not be shared with any other individual.  Licensee may
           redesignate the Named User for a Program, whether temporarily or
           not, no more than four (4) times in any twelve (12) month period.
           A Named User may not use a Program on more than two (2) Computers
           simultaneously.  In the case of Standalone Named User Licenses
           licensed as part of a group, Licensee shall be responsible for,
           and shall assign a central administrator the task of,
           administering the Licenses and installing the Programs, including
           new versions of the Programs delivered during any paid Software
           Maintenance Service term. 

    3.2.2. Designated Computer. The Programs may only be installed and
           operated on a single, designated Computer, provided the Computer
           is not a network server, and the Programs are only operated from
           that Computer's console by only one Licensed User at any given
           time.  Licensee may redesignate the Computer for a Program to a
           different Computer, whether temporarily or not, no more than four
           (4) times in any twelve (12) month period.  In the case of
           Designated Computer Licenses licensed as part of a group,
           Licensee shall be responsible for, and shall assign a central
           administrator the task of, administering the Licenses and
           installing the Programs, including new versions of the Programs
           delivered during any paid Software Maintenance Service term.   

    3.2.3. Network Named User.  Programs may only be installed in a central
           location on a single designated network server.  Licensee must
           run the License Manager in its User-Based mode, and edit the
           Local License Options file to maintain a list of Named Users
           authorized to access and operate each Program. Licensee may
           re-edit the list of Named Users in the Local License Options file
           and may redesignate Named Users for a Program, whether
           temporarily or not, no more than four (4) times in any twelve
           (12) month period, provided the number of Named Users in the file
           never exceeds the number licensed per Program.  Portions of the
           Programs may be installed on individual Computers to accelerate
           startup times, as long as the installations on the individual
           Computers are controlled by the License Manager on the network
           server.  A Named User may not use a Program on more than two (2)
           Computers simultaneously.  A Computer login of a Named User may
           not be shared with any other individual.

    3.2.4. Network Concurrent User.  The Programs may only be installed in a
           central location on a single designated network server. Licensee
           must run the License Manager in its Concurrent mode and may have
           only as many Licensed Users simultaneously operating a Program at
           any given time as the number of Concurrent keys acquired for that
           Program.  Subject to the foregoing, a Licensed User of the
           Concurrent License Option may utilize the Programs on any number
           of Computers served by a single License Manager provided that,
           before using a Program on any Computer, the Licensed User checks
           out a separate Concurrent key from the License Manager for that
           Computer.  Portions of the Programs may be installed on
           individual Computers to accelerate startup times, as long as the
           installations on the individual Computers are controlled by the
           License Manager on the network server.  Licensees of the
           Concurrent License Option are prohibited from providing Program
           access to users located outside the country in which the License
           Manager server is installed unless Licensee has contracted for
           global use.  For the purposes of the Concurrent License Option,
           all servers located in a member country of the North American
           Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA") shall be considered located in the
           same country as those of the other NAFTA members, and all servers
           located in Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, or any member country of
           the European Union ("EU") shall be considered located in the same
           country.   

  3.3 MATLAB Distributed Computing Server.  Licensees of the MATLAB
      Distributed Computing Server Program ("MDCS") are permitted to install
      and make available Programs, other than any Ineligible Program, on one
      or more  Computers ("Computer Cluster")  solely for use  through the
      MDCS, provided that (1) the Programs on the Computer Cluster are
      controlled by a single License Manager on a single designated network
      server for each MDCS, (2) the number of simultaneous Program sessions
      does not exceed the number of MDCS workers acquired, (3) access to any
      Program, whether in the MDCS or otherwise, remains limited to those
      persons who are Licensed Users of such Programs and the Parallel
      Computing Toolbox; and 4) access to any Program, including the MDCS,
      is not made available (i) to any Third Party without the advance
      written consent of MathWorks, or (ii) to any user outside the country
      in which the MDCS' License Manager server is installed, unless the
      Licensee has contracted for global use.  For the purposes of this
      Section 3.3, all MDCS License Manager servers located in a member
      country of the North American Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA") shall be
      considered located in the same country as those of the other NAFTA
      members, and all MDCS License Manager servers located in Iceland,
      Norway, Switzerland, or any member country of the European Union
      ("EU") shall be considered located in the same country.

THE MATHWORKS, INC. SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT - Deployment Addendum

This is an Addendum to The MathWorks, Inc. Software License Agreement (the
"Agreement"), and the terms and conditions of this Addendum are incorporated
therein.  Each capitalized term used herein and not defined herein shall
have the meaning ascribed to it in the Agreement. 

1. PURPOSE.  The MathWorks, Inc. Software License Agreement (the
   "Agreement") contains restrictions prohibiting Licensee from modifying,
   distributing, or providing access to the Programs or any Program
   Components (as defined below), except as expressly provided in this
   Addendum.  If the Programs licensed by Licensee under the Agreement
   contain Source Code or Object Code Program Components, then this Addendum
   sets forth the Licensee's rights with respect to creating Applications
   and Derivative Forms and distributing Applications, Derivative Forms, and
   Deployment Programs, as well as certain additional obligations related
   thereto.  

   MathWorks or its Licensors retain all right, title, and interest in its
   Programs, Program Components, and Derivative Forms of its Programs.

2. USER CREATED FILES.  This Addendum does not apply to MATLAB code files, 
   MDL-files, MEX-files, MAT-files, VHDL-files, Verilog-files, FIG-files 
   and P-files that are created by Licensee and that do not include any code
   obtained from MATLAB code files, MAT-files, P-code, MDL-files, C/C++ 
   files, VHDL-files, Verilog-files, TLC-files, or other Source Code files 
   supplied with the Programs ("User Files").  Licensee may distribute, 
   sublicense, and resell without restriction, User Files.  

3. NONCOMPETITION.  Licensee agrees not to use the Programs, Derivative
   Forms, Generated Forms, or Program Components to make or distribute its
   own or a Third Party's Application, a principal purpose of which, as
   reasonably determined by MathWorks, is to perform the same or similar
   functions as Programs licensed by MathWorks or which replaces any
   component of the Programs.  Licensee shall not otherwise use the Programs
   to compete with the products or businesses of MathWorks, including by
   distributing Libraries, or any form of an entire Program or a substantial
   portion of a Program.  

4. DEFINITIONS.

  4.1. Application.  A software file that Licensee has created by either (a)
       using a MathWorks Program to compile or translate Licensee created
       Source Code or (b) incorporating or linking any part of any Source
       Code, library file, or other Program Component provided with the
       Program.  An Application must contain original code developed by
       Licensee and must provide substantial functionality not contained in,
       or provided by, the Program Components that are incorporated into
       such Application.  If a software file created by a Licensee
       incorporates Program Components, but does not meet the requirements
       of the previous sentence, then it is a Derivative Form (as defined
       below).  An Application may contain Linked Object Code which, if such
       Object Code was not Linked to the Application and was a standalone
       file, would otherwise have been deemed a Derivative Form. 

  4.2. Application License.  A license granted by Licensee to its end-users
       for the installation and use of Licensee's Application.

  4.3. Generated Forms.  The output of the MATLAB Compiler, Real-Time
       Workshop, Stateflow Coder, Simulink HDL Coder, Embedded Coders, and
       other MathWorks' code generation Programs in the form of Source Code,
       as well as such Source Code converted to Object Code or Linked forms.

  4.4. Derivative Forms.  A  software file that Licensee has derived from
       one or more Program Components (including without limitation by
       incorporating, translating, or modifying, in whole or in part, any
       Program Component), and which, if modified or copied without
       MathWorks' authorization, would constitute a copyright infringement
       or breach of the Agreement.  A software file created by Licensee
       which qualifies as an "Application" under the above definition shall
       not be deemed a Derivative Form.

  4.5. Linked.   An executable or loadable file created by a compiler or
       linker program combining Object Code module files.

        Fortran, which must be translated or compiled into machine-readable
        language before it can be executed by a computer.  Source Code also
        includes header files and other human-readable files necessary for a
        Program to be compiled in the higher-level language.

  4.11. Standalone Application.  An Application created using programming
        languages and tools other than the Programs, which executes outside
        of the Programs.

  4.12. Deployment Program.  Any MathWorks Program that either (a) generates
        Object Code or Source Code in response to user input, or (b)
        contains executable functions or data accessed by an Application

5. DEPLOYMENT PROGRAMS.  Licensed Users of MathWorks' Deployment Programs
   may automatically generate code from MATLAB code files, Simulink/Stateflow
   diagrams, and other representations, into Generated Forms.  Furthermore,
   Licensee may copy and deploy these Generated Forms for use outside of the
   Programs.

   Not all Programs are eligible for deployment within Licensee's
   Application.  For a list of Ineligible Programs see
   www.mathworks.com/ineligible_programs. 

  5.1. MATLAB Application Deployment Programs

    5.1.1. MATLAB Compiler. Licensee may use and distribute the MCR
           Libraries for the sole purpose of running Licensed User's
           Application generated by the MATLAB Compiler.  Licensee may
           deploy, at no cost, copies of such Applications that incorporate
           the MCR Libraries and compiled versions of MATLAB code files from
           the licensed Programs required for the Application.  No further 
           fees shall be due to MathWorks for such deployment within such
           Applications, regardless of whether the Application is
           distributed solely for Licensee's Internal Operations or to Third
           Parties. 

           Licensee may make copies of the MCR Libraries accessible for
           deployment on an internal server provided such deployment is
           solely to its Licensed Users for use with an Application and for
           Licensee's Internal Operations only.  Licensee agrees to employ
           the same security measures to protect the MCR Libraries as it
           uses to safeguard Licensee's own proprietary intellectual
           property, but in no event  less than reasonable care.  No further
           fees shall be due to MathWorks for such server deployment.  

           Licensee is prohibited from making copies of the MCR Libraries
           accessible to any Third Party separate from a Licensed User's
           Application.  

      5.1.1.1. Licensed User may include, by compilation for deployment,
               only those select MATLAB code files from the licensed 
               Programs required for the Application.  

      5.1.1.2. In no event shall Licensee distribute any library header
               files.

      5.1.1.3. Licensee's Application may not provide functionality or
               behavior similar to that of the MATLAB command line.  

      5.1.1.4. Licensee's Application may not allow operation of the code
               generation capabilities of Programs.

      5.1.1.5. Licensee's Application may not provide access to an entire
               Program or a substantial portion of a Program. 

      5.1.1.6. Licensee shall include the notice "MATLAB. (c) 1984 - [INSERT
               YEAR MATLAB VERSION PUBLISHED] The MathWorks, Inc." in the
               deployed Application's About Box, or similar visible
               location, and in the applicable documentation distributed
               with each copy of the Application.  

      5.1.1.7. Licensee must state in the documentation or other materials
               distributed with the Application that Licensee's limited
               rights to the deployment are governed by a certain license
               agreement between Licensee and MathWorks. Licensee may not
               modify or remove any license agreement file (MathWorks or
               Third-Party) that is included with the MCR Libraries ("MCR
               Library License").  Licensee shall insure that any licensee
               of the Application must first accept the terms of such MCR
               Library License prior to installation of the Application.

  5.2. Simulink Application Deployment Programs 

    5.2.1. Deployment Programs.  MathWorks provides directories of C, C++,
           Assembly, linker command files, template makefiles, project
           files, and TLC source code files with Programs that implement the
           real-time framework, code generation instructions, libraries, and
           Application Programming Interface (API) for use with the code
           generated by the Simulink family of products, including Real-Time
           Workshop, Stateflow Coder, Simulink HDL Coder, Embedded Coders
           and other Programs.  Licensee may use, copy, and modify these
           files in source code form for different development targets
           provided that they are only copied for development use in
           connection with Real-Time Workshop, Embedded Coders, Stateflow
           Coder, or other code generation Programs.

      5.2.1.1. Licensee may copy and deploy these files outside of the
               Programs in Linked Object Code form or Source Code form, if
               only used in combination with code generated by those
               Programs as part of a larger standalone Application. 

      5.2.1.2. No further fees shall be due to MathWorks for such deployment
               within Licensee's Application, regardless of whether the
               Application is deployed solely for Licensee's Internal
               Operations or to Third Parties.

    5.2.2. Real-Time Windows Target.  Licensee may not incorporate Real-Time
           Windows Target into an Application for deployment without
           contracting with MathWorks for an OEM or VAR agreement. 

    5.2.3. xPC Target.  Licensee may develop Applications that incorporate
           Linked-in copies of xPC Target and those files required for the
           Application that have been compiled or otherwise obtained from
           Real-Time Workshop and/or Stateflow Coder on a single development
           PC, and download that Application to a target PC directly
           connected to the development PC by either Ethernet or serial
           connections.  When running on xPC TargetBox, the Application may
           also be used for standalone operation, without connection to the
           development PC.  

      5.2.3.1 The right to distribute the Application beyond the target PC
              is contingent upon acquiring a License for the xPC Target
              Embedded Option.  No further fees shall be due to MathWorks
              for such deployment within Licensee's Application, regardless
              of whether the Application is deployed solely for Licensee's
              Internal Operations or to Third Parties. Additionally, the
              Embedded Option License allows for the deployment of API DLL's
              beyond the development PC.  No further fees shall be due to
              MathWorks for such deployment outside of an Application,
              regardless of whether the API DLL's are deployed solely for
              Licensee's Internal Operations or to Third Parties.  

6. OTHER SOURCE CODE AND SHARED OBJECT CODE LIBRARIES. 

  6.1. Programs may include selected Source Code and shared Object Code
       library files that implement various documented application
       programming interface capabilities of the Programs for which the
       Source Code or shared library file is part. 

    6.1.1. Licensed User may use and modify the selected Source Code files
           solely for creation of Licensee's own Applications. Licensee may
           copy and distribute Object Code compiled from this Source Code,
           but only as either standalone Object Code file (regardless
           whether a Derivative Form) or Object Code Linked to the
           Application, and only for use with and deployment of Licensee's
           own Application. 

    6.1.2. Licensee may use, copy and distribute shared Object Code library
           files (regardless whether a Derivative Form) for deployment of
           Licensee's own Application, but only if a header file exists in
           the Program for the shared library file. Licensee may not copy or
           distribute header files themselves.

    6.1.3. Licensee may not transfer Source Code, development rights, or
           development capabilities for any Source Code or Object Code to
           any Third Party.

  6.2. MAT-files.  Licensed User may create and distribute Applications that
       read MAT-files using the MAT-file API, however, if such Applications
       are distributed to Third Parties, they must also implement MAT-file
       write capability.

7. DERIVATIVE FORMS.  A Licensee shall only be permitted to distribute a
   Derivative Form to Third Parties (a) to the extent expressly permitted
   under Articles 5 or 6 of this Addendum, or (b) subject to the
   requirements of this Article 7.  A Licensee may only distribute a
   Derivative Form to a Third Party under this Article 7 if such Third Party
   is bound by a Software License Agreement with MathWorks that requires
   such Third Party to treat such Derivative Forms received from Licensee as
   such Third Party's own Derivative Form thereunder.  Licensee agrees that
   if such a Third Party provides Licensee with software that is a
   Derivative Form under the terms of such Third Party's Software License
   Agreement with MathWorks (or would otherwise be a Derivative Form under
   the terms of this Agreement), then Licensee shall treat such software as
   a Derivative Form hereunder as if Licensee has modified or generated the
   software itself.

8. WEB APPLICATIONS.  Only Programs licensed under the Network Concurrent
   User or Designated Computer Activation Types may be called from within a
   web Standalone Application, provided the web Standalone Application does
   not provide access to the MATLAB command line, or any of the licensed
   Programs with code generation capabilities.  In addition, Licensed Users
   may not provide access to an entire Program or a substantial portion of a
   Program.  Such operation of a Standalone Application via a web interface
   may be provided to an unlimited number of web browser clients, at no
   cost, for Licensee's own use for its Internal Operations, and for use by
   Third Parties. 

9. APPLICATION LICENSING.  For any distribution of Applications containing
   Object Code or Generated Forms to:

  9.1. Licensee's internal organization:  Licensee shall take appropriate
       action by instruction, agreement, or otherwise with any recipients of
       the Application, so as to enable Licensee to satisfy its obligations

  9.3. Notwithstanding the termination of the Agreement, all valid
       Application licenses shall remain and continue in full force and
       effect, and, if the Agreement was not terminated due to:  (a)
       Licensee's failure to pay the applicable fees to MathWorks, (b)
       Licensee's violation of the License restrictions, or (c) violation of
       MathWorks' proprietary rights in the Programs; then Licensee may
       continue to use the Programs to support Applications that have been
       placed in use pursuant to an Application License prior to the
       effective date of termination.

10. DISCLAIMER OF OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITY.
